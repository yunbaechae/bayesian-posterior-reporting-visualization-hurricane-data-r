# Bayesian Posterior Reporting and Visualization of Hurricane Data in R

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 2 (2023)

This assignment focused on Bayesian posterior estimation and visualization for hurricane frequency using Gamma-Poisson model. Emphasized reproducible reporting, plots, and structured documentation.

## Key Tasks
- Fitted Gamma-Poisson Bayesian model  
- Generated posterior distributions and credibility estimates  
- Visualized results and reported financial implications  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming for Bayesian analysis and visualization  
- Reproducible posterior reporting and plotting  
- Clear documentation of statistical and financial results  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all code, posteriors, plots, and explanations.)
